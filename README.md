raxa_demo_2_April
=================

This is the latest version of the demo as on 2 April 2014.

I did not replace the previous version because on running the MainView as the initial view, 
when I navigate to navigationView the addLocationButton is not displayed which does not allow me to add new
locations and save them.
Right Now NavigationView has been set as initial view and the login form can be accessed by setting the MainView as initial 
view. Otherwise all of this can be viewed in architect.
